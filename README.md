### Getting Started
Install the requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run a sample program:

### Note
This was created for the [Stupid Shit That No One Needs & Terrible Ideas Hackathon](https://stupidhackathon.com/).
As such, it's very much in a hackathon-demo state.
I might polish it up a bit at some point, but if you want, 
feel free to submit a PR!
